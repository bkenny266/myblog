Switch datefield to datetimefield
Hook edit post functionality to the interface via Manage posts
Work on delete post functionality
Much better unit testing
Better decoupling of the app from the project - urls are mostly good
  except for login/logout which can be addressed by reexamining
  the User/Author relationship. Templates and static files are not
  at all decoupled from project, currently.
Not super happy with how the blog posts look at the moment,
  "create/edit post" template forms need to be cleaned up.
